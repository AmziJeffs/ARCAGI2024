Results of fine-tuning LLaMa model to solve tasks. All notebooks stored
on Kaggle. We do not fine-tune during inference phase, which is a 
significant limitation to this approach.

Notebook: Version 1, "First_Test_Run"
Model: "unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B"
Max new tokens: 256
Epochs: 2
Prompt: "Your job is to help me solve Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks. You should carefully examine each train input grid and train output grid, and find the general pattern for turning input grid into output grid. Then, tell me what the test output grid is, given the test input grid.\n\n"
Grid encoding: with square brackets, single line
Evaluation set results:
Number of non-null guesses:          119.5 / 400
Number of guesses with correct size: 85.5 / 400
Number of correct guesses:           12.0 / 400
